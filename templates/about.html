        <p>
            In order to foster the spirit of competition, we are introducting <strong>rated prompts!</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our rating system is based off the <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> rating system. For each
            rated daily prompt, you rating will change based on your place in the rankings. Only the first attempt 
            within the time range of the prompt (midnight to midnight UTC) will be used for the rankings. 
            However, you are always free to practice on old daily prompts in the archive. <!-- TODO link to archive -->
