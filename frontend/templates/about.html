            We are actively developing Wikipedia Speedruns preparing for an official release! This means that things might be broken, have bugs, or have stability issues.

        <h4 id="ads">Ads</h4>
        <p>
            As Wikipedia Speedruns has grown, so have the costs of maintaining the site. We have therefore
            decided to start introducing ads onto our website. The hope is that these ads will are not intrusive
            and do not negatively affect your experience too much.

            Once the ad revenue surpasses the cost of hosting our servers, we will donate half of the excess
            to Wikipedia and use the remaining half towards further improving Wikipedia Speedruns.

            Feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@wikispeedruns.com">support@wikispeedruns.com</a> 
            with any questions or concerns
